/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * In order for this class to work the driver "inpout32.dll" 
 * must be installed in the dirrectory Windows/System32
 * 
 * The DLL Inpout32:
 * The functions in the DLL are implemented in two source files, "inpout32drv.cpp" and "osversion.cpp". 
 * osversion.cpp checks the version of operating system. "inpout32drv.cpp" does installing the kernel mode driver, 
 * loading it , writing/ reading parallel port etc... The two functions exported from inpout32.dll are
 * 
 * 1) Inp32(), reads data from a specified parallel port register.
 * 2) Out32(), writes data to specified parallel port register.
 * 
 * The other functions implemented in Inpout32.dll are 
 * 1) DllMain(), called when dll is loaded or unloaded. When the dll is loaded , it 
 * checks the OS version and loads hwinterface.sys if needed.
 * 2) Closedriver(), close the opened driver handle. called before unloading the driver.
 * 3) Opendriver(), open a handle to hwinterface driver.
 * 4) inst() , Extract 'hwinterface.sys' from binary resource to 'systemroot\drivers' 
 * directory and creates a service. This function is called when 'Opendriver' function fails 
 * to open a valid handle to 'hwinterface' service.
 * 5) start() , starts the hwinterface service using Service Control Manager APIs.
 * 6) SystemVersion() Checks the OS version and returns appropriate code.
